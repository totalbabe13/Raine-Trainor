    Hi Raine! You made it here! YAY!  
    Here is a Cheat Sheet for you to refrence,
    At the bottom of this document there is the template you can copy and paste into your new project page.
    You dont need to change, type or edit anything at all in this doc.

    Also all of the text you see that is GREEN (like this text): 
    - Is baisically invisible to the browser
    - It serves as a comment function. 
    - You can leave yourself notes if you need to remember anything.
    - You can also delete or add comment code and it wont affect how your page functions at all.
    - You can make comments like this: -->

    <!-- Hello Raine I am a comment, NOTE that I'm inside these dashed litte arrows -->

    How to add a project CHEAT SHEET ðŸ’• <3
    + + +
    ADDING IMAGES:
    REMINDER:    
    If you are adding images, they should already be:
    - Named properly (numbered in order and NO CAPS or SPACES, using the _ as spaces)
    - Sized Properly (no image should bemore than a 1MB, honestly, it'll take a longer time to load)
    - Uploaded to where they are supposed to be (Double check to make sure eveything is placed correctly)
    STEPS:
    1. In the EXAMPLE code line below (<img> ...): look for the src="".
    2. Type in your file name inside the quotation marks. 
    3. Include the .jpg extentions(or what ever type of file you are using, lets say maybe its a .gif or .png). 
    4. in the alt="..." part of the code add a small note about what the image is (not super important),
    *** BUT, if your images do appear for some reason, this text will appear FYI
    
    EXAMPLE list of images added: 
    <img class="project-img" src="1_example_file_name.jpg"          alt="text context for the visually impared">
    <img class="project-img" src="2_type_your_file_name_here.jpg"  alt="title of work and year maybe">
    <img class="project-img" src="3_one_more.jpg" alt="picture of apple ... not super important">

    ADDING TEXT: 
    STEPS:
    1. To add text to your page:
    *** Your text must always go inside of this text-container. 
    like this:    
    <div class="text-container">
        //INSERT TEXT STUFF IN HERE//
        <div class="text-spacer"></div>
    </div> 

    2. Text elements for you to use:
    *TITLE: 
    <p class="project-text title">TYPE TITLE HERE</p>
    
    *LINKS:
    <a href="TYPE URL HERE" target="blank">
        <p class="project-text link">TEXT you will SEE/CLICK</p>
    </a>

    *TEXT BLOCK:
    <p class="project-text">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. 
        Adipisci veritatis optio cumque, inventore sequi pariatur 
        mollitia corrupti tempora facilis aliquam dolorum iure 
        labore quae minima voluptates ducimus alias. A, iure.
    </p> 

    - need extra space between text elememnts?
    *ADD LINE:
    <br>

    *** NOTES from Leo ***
    - You can configure these elements in any order you want.
    You could have images first and text last,
    or Images, then text, then Images etc.
    
    -You can have more than one text container.
    (Think of the text container as a image slide you can add or remove in an image carousel)

    - *** IMPORTANT ***
    You'll notice something in the code below that looks like this:
        <div class="scroller-container">
    Everything you add, wether its text or image, MUST GO INSIDE of the scoller container

    
    Example Below: 
    You can copy paste everything below into you new project html Page :)
    HERE IS YOUR TEMPLATE ðŸ’•
