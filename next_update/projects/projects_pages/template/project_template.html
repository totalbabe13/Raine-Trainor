    Hi Raine! You made it here! YAY!  
    Here is a Cheat Sheet for you to refrence,
    At the bottom of this document there is the template you can copy and paste whenever you are creating
    a new project page.
    It LOOKS like a lot, but its not
    You dont need to change, type or edit anything at all in this doc.

    Also all of the text you see that is THIS COLOR: 
    - It serves as a COMMENT function.
    - Is baisically INVISIBLE to the browser 
    - You can leave yourself notes if you need to remember anything.
    - You can also delete or add comment code and it wont affect how your page functions at all.
    - You can make comments like this: -->

    <!-- Hello Raine I am a comment, NOTE that I'm inside these dashed litte arrows -->
         I am not a comment! OH SNAP!

    ADDING IMAGES:

    REMINDER:    
    If you are adding images, they should already be:
    - Named properly (numbered in order and NO CAPS, SPACES, DASHES or SPECIAL CHARACTES, using the _ as spaces)
    - Sized Properly (no image should bemore than a 1MB, honestly, it'll take a longer time to load)
    - Uploaded to where they are supposed to be (Double check to make sure eveything is placed correctly)


    STEPS:
    1. In the EXAMPLE code line below (<img> ...): look for this: src="" 
    (where it says 1_FILE_NAME.jpg)
    
    2. Type in your file name inside the quotation marks. 
    
    3. Include the .jpg extentions(or what ever type of file you are using, lets say maybe its a .gif or .png). 
    
    4. In the alt="..." part of the code add a small note about what the image is (not super important),
    *** BUT, if your images do appear for some reason, this text will appear FYI
    
    5. You have the option of including a CAPTION,
    if you decide you don't need one, 
    just delete the text that is there -> (INSERT CAPTION HERE).

    6. FOLLOW this pattern for each image.

    EXAMPLE list of images: 

        <div class="captioned-image-wrapper">
            <img class="project-img" src="1_FILE_NAME.jpg"  alt=" include text for visually impared">
            <p class="caption-text">INSERT CAPTION HERE</p>
        </div>

        <div class="captioned-image-wrapper">
            <img class="project-img" src="2_FILE_NAME.jpg"  alt="include text for visually impared">
            <p class="caption-text">INSERT CAPTION HERE</p>
        </div>

        <div class="captioned-image-wrapper">
            <img class="project-img" src="#_FLE_NAME.jpg"  alt="include text for visually impared">
            <p class="caption-text">INSERT CAPTION HERE</p>
        </div>

    ADDING VIDEO:
    STEPS:
    1. Using Handbrake, re-size video as much as possible for the web
    
    2. Upload to Vimeo
    
    3. Copy Vimeo embed snip-it
    
    4. Paste into your html template like you would add an image.

    EXAMPLE VIDEO:
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/465592701" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    ADDING TEXT: 
    (Titles, Links, Text Blocks)
    There will be a big example after this explanation:

    STEPS:
    1. To add text to your page:
    *** Your text must always go inside of this text-container
   
    <div class="text-container">
        //->INSERT TEXT CONTENT IN HERE<-//
        <div class="text-spacer"></div>
    </div> 

    2. add text Elements:
    
    TITLE: 
    <p class="project-text title">TYPE TITLE HERE</p>
    
    LINKS:
    <a href="TYPE URL HERE" target="blank">
        <p class="project-text link">TEXT you will SEE/CLICK</p>
    </a>

    TEXT BLOCK:
    <p class="project-text">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. 
        Adipisci veritatis optio cumque, inventore sequi pariatur 
        mollitia corrupti tempora facilis aliquam dolorum iure 
        labore quae minima voluptates ducimus alias. A, iure.
    </p> 

    *** NOTES from Leo ***
    - You can configure these elements in any order you want.
    You could have images first and text last,
    or Images, then text, then Images etc.
    
    -You can have more than one text container.
    (Think of the text container as a slide you can add or remove in an image carousel)

    - *** IMPORTANT ***
    You'll notice something in the code below that looks like this:
        <div class="scroller-container">
    Everything you add, wether its text or image, MUST GO INSIDE of the scoller container
    
    ~ DONT WORRY ~
    All of this will make more sense in the template below.
    I know this llok like a lot, but its just a refrence guide
    Its gets easier very quickly

    After you're finished plugging in your all your content,
    You can delete all of the commentted notes  
    and the extra spacing I added 
    ~ You can also always look at other project pages for refrence ~

    PANIC? Just holler at me boo!
