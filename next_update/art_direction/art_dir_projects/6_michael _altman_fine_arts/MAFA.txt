Michael Altman Fine Art

This was a branding / identity project so I'm not sure what would look best...but I have the logo that I designed for them and then a GIF of the site I designed for them (don't judge, they had horrible taste so it's VVV simple). I also have some business cards I designed for them but idk how that would live on here??
